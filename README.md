# Dotfiles for Arch with XFCE and i3wm

![GIF](screenshot/output.gif)

These are my dotfiles for Arch Linux using XFCE as the DE and i3 as the WM. These are my personal dotfiles that I keep synced between my laptop (x230) and my home machine.

Dotfiles are managed by [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)

I've created a rudimentary install script but it's still not up-to-date (and probably never will be since I modify so frequently)

## Neovim and VS Code

## zsh

I wanted to avoid a heavy zshrc and heavily utilized [chris@machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTLYiNvRIVI) zsh dotfiles for a light and minimal setup.
